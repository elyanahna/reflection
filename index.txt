<p class="content">
Second quarter has ups and downs that helped me became a better student and of course, person. Those  problems helped me build a better relationship to another people especially my classmates.
<br><br>
I had an incredible time this quarter, thanks to the various activities and events that were organized. From engaging workshops to exciting social gatherings, each experience brought something unique and enjoyable. I truly feel committed to making the most of these opportunities, and I can't wait to see what the next quarter has to offer!
